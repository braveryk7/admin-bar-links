=== Description ===

## What Admin Bar Tools?
This plugin allows you to add useful links to the admin bar.
Until now, in order to check PageSpeed ​​Insights, Twitter search, and Google index, I had to open each site and copy and paste the URL to check it.
But with Admin Bar Tools you can do it with just one click.
This is very revolutionary.

Since the top page of each tool can be accessed from the management page, there is no unnecessary operation.
We are happy to help you with your writing.
